## 📋 Vercel Deployment Checklist

### 1. ✅ Code Pushed to GitHub
- Repository: `michaelkd01/asx-stock-analyzer`
- Branch: `main`
- Status: **COMPLETE**

### 2. ✅ Alpha Vantage API Key
- You've created your API key
- You've added it to Vercel environment variables
- Variable name: `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`

### 3. 🔄 Vercel Auto-Deploy
Since your Vercel project is connected to GitHub, it should automatically:
- Detect the new push
- Start building
- Deploy in 2-3 minutes

### 4. 📍 Check Deployment Status
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Look for your `asx-stock-analyzer` project
3. You should see a new deployment in progress

## 🧪 Test Your Live App

Once deployed (2-3 minutes), test with these ASX tickers:

### Real-Time Price Check
Try these stocks and verify you're getting real prices:

| Ticker | Company | Expected Price Range |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **CBA** | Commonwealth Bank | $105-115 |
| **BHP** | BHP Group | $42-48 |
| **CSL** | CSL Limited | $280-295 |
| **WBC** | Westpac | $26-30 |
| **ANZ** | ANZ Bank | $28-32 |

### How to Verify Real Data
1. Enter ticker (e.g., "CBA")
2. Check the footer - should say "Alpha Vantage (Real Data)"
3. Compare price with Google Finance: https://www.google.com/finance/quote/CBA:ASX

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If prices look wrong:
1. **Check API Key in Vercel:**
   - Settings → Environment Variables
   - Ensure `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` is set
   - Click "Redeploy" after adding

2. **Check API Limits:**
   - Free tier: 25 requests/day
   - If exceeded, app shows demo data with note

3. **Force Redeploy:**
   ```
   Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → ⋮ → Redeploy
   ```

### If deployment fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Most common issue: Missing dependencies
3. Solution: Our package.json has all dependencies ✅

## 📊 What's Working Now

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Real ASX Prices | ✅ | Via Alpha Vantage API |

| Company Profiles | ✅ | Basic info for major stocks |
| Price Changes | ✅ | Daily change & percentage |
| Financial Metrics | ⚠️ | Limited (Alpha Vantage free tier) |
